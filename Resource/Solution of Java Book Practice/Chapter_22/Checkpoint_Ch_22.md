The constant factor is ignored in big O notation, because it has no impact on the growth rate of the time complexity function.  

A non-dominating term is ignored in Big O notation, because as the input size grows, the dominating term grows much faster than the non-dominating term. Ignoring the non-dominating term will introduce an error in the estimation but keeps things much cleaner.
